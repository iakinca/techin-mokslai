          They are the only birds that feed by filtering water. After immersing
          their beaks in water, flamingos use their tongues to drive water into
          their beaks and cough it up through slits in their beaks, collecting
          small plants and animals.

          More than one species of flamingo lives in the world. They are common
          in South America, Africa, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean
          region. Not all flamingos are this bright pink. Some are red, some are
          almost white.
