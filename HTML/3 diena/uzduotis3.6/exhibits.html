        <h2>The Louvre’s Most Famous Painting: The Mona Lisa</h2>
        <b>1. Mona Lisa</b>, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da
        Vinci, probably the world’s most famous painting. It was painted
        sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence,
        and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an
        object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The sitter’s mysterious smile
        and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing
        investigation and fascination.

        <h2>2. Venus de Milo</h2>
        <b> Venus de Milo</b>, ancient statue commonly thought to represent
        Aphrodite, now in Paris at the Louvre. It was carved from marble by
        Alexandros, a sculptor of Antioch on the Maeander River about 150 bce.
        It was found in pieces on the Aegean island of Melos on April 8, 1820,
        and was subsequently presented to Louis XVIII (who then donated it to
        the Louvre in 1821). Though it was reconstructed to a standing posture,
        the statue’s arms were never found. An inscription that is not displayed
        with the statue states that “Alexandros, son of Menides, citizen of
        Antioch of Maeander made the statue.” The figure’s origin on the island
        of Melos has led some to think she may be Amphitrite, the Greek goddess
        of the sea. <br />

        <h2>3. Liberty Leading the People</h2>
        Eugène Delacroix’s most famous painting has become a symbol of
        revolution. It’s important to know that Liberty Leading the People
        references the July Revolution of 1830, and not the French Revolution of
        1789. It depicts the moment Parisians rose against the king. Charles X
        was overthrown after three days of fighting known as les trois
        glorieuses. He was replaced on the throne by Louis-Philippe. The artist
        shows the people of Paris breaking through the city’s barricades. They
        are led by a female figure, part Greek goddess and part woman of the
        people. She is the representation of Liberty and is seen waving the
        French flag, known as the Tricolor. The flag had been used previously as
        a symbol of revolution, and later the French Empire. It was banned
        between 1815 and 1830. Delacroix deliberately used the colors of the
        flag—red, white, and blue—in combination in the painting in several
        places. The work is an enduring symbol of liberty and freedom and is
        often reproduced in both art and politics.

        <h2>4. The Winged Victory of Samothrace</h2>
        The Winged Victory of Samothrace is one of the Louvre’s best-known women
        (the other two being the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo). In the museum’s
        Denon Wing, she graces the top of the Daru staircase, a position that
        pays homage to her original place of display. The statue comes from the
        Greek island of Samothrace, where it was strategically positioned at an
        elevated location so that it could be seen from afar. The statue dates
        to around 190 BCE and is a representation of the goddess of victory,
        Nike. It was uncovered in 1863 and pieced together from over a hundred
        fragments. Her arms and head were never found. It is believed that the
        sculpture was created to celebrate a victorious sea battle.
